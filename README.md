# p5-examples

This repository contains different projects I wrote with p5js. They are managed with p5-manager (https://github.com/chiunhau/p5-manager).
See each project folder's README for information

## Usage

Start the server with `p5 server` and go to http://localhost:5555. You can also use a simple webserver.
For example, on windows you can use python3: `python -m http.server`
Or with python2 on linux: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
